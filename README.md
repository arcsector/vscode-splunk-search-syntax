# vscode-splunk-search-syntax Extension README

Main repo for vscode splunk syntax highlighting.

## Initial version

- Highlights main search functions and eval functions, as well as pipes and escape keys
- Autocompletes macro ticks and brackets as well as quotes

## TODO

- [ ] Change highlighting color to match Splunk search bar
- [ ] Highlight operators (AND OR by as)
- [ ] Highlight macros
- [ ] Highlight command options
  - For example, stats has the parameter partitions=X, partitions should be highlighted in this instance only after the = sign has been placed
